This repository contains the scripts that were used to produce the tables in the paper: "AntMAN: Anthology of Mixture ANalysis tools". 

Specifically, we produced two sets of tables for:
- Benchmarking AntMAN against BNPmix for the univariate gaussian model. Results of samplers implemented in both AntMAN and BNPmix are returned.
- Illustrating the results of AntMAN for the multivariate bernoulli sampler.  

### TODO: add more context
